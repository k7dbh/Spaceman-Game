## ðŸ“ƒ Game Description:

Spaceman is a game player guess the word by typing letters from the keyboard within restricted number of tries. To win you need to get the right letters to know the random word otherwise you will lose. 

## ðŸ”Ž Background info:
I am creating this project as part of my studies at General Assembly's software engineering bootcamp.

The reason I chose to create a Spaceman game as my project is because I found the idea basic, fun and intriguing for a beginner's game project, and at the same time having the oppurtunity to learn much of JavaScript's fundamentals along with CSS Grid which I believe will be valuable knowledge for me in the future.
